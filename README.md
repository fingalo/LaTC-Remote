===========

Pebble app for connecting to Telldus LIVE! server.

Based on the work from https://github.com/mickeprag/telldus-live-pebble.git

Enter your 2 Telldus developer keys on lines 63, 64.

When installing, press the setting button in the Pebble app to login to Telldus..
There sometimes (always?) will be an auth error message when loggin in but then go back to the pebble app and press settings again, the you get a second screen. Press yes.

From now on it will connect when starting the app.
